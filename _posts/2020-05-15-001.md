Rudolow's very very subjective perspective! Writes with subjective attention and judgment, but the process is based on objective and fair data. I read and analyze various fields of writing and make my own conclusions. This time, too.

<br>



What is the most valuable character franchise in the world? This is a very curious question for anyone who loves characters very much and wants to analyze every character in the world. As soon as you ask this question, the characters you love will come to mind. The loyal fandoms of the character franchise are also certain and powerful. This is especially true for character franchises in the comparison group today. They have their own strong fandoms and are willing to pay for their beloved character franchise. It also very much. Who will be the most valuable character franchise among them? We will draw conclusions through various criteria.

##### Mickey Mouse & Friends vs The Simpsons vs Harry Potter



You can either understand or oppose these candidates. In particular, some of the Disney fans may have thought of other friends they loved instead of Mickey and Friends. 'Pooh and friends', or 'Iron Man and friends' who have been together relatively recently. But here along with these candidates, Mickey and his friends deserve enough. I think you can understand enough through the following criteria. But of course there were others who would join these candidates. The candidates had already considered enough, but unfortunately this time they had to miss. The next time I write on this subject again, I think it would be good to compete again with the candidates who have missed this time. If there are any candidates who are missing on this list, but must enter, please send us feedback.

#### Criteria 1. Heritage



There are many important criteria for studying and analyzing characters. One of them is heritage. How long the character franchise lasted and has been loved for a long time is a very important criterion. Maintaining a franchise for decades cannot be achieved without that much love and support. As everyone knows, there are so many characters that flash and disappear very briefly. (Of course, it would be a good thing if you had a little glitter.) The character franchise introduced here has maintained at least 20 years of vitality and, of course, still shines brilliantly. And one of these candidates has lasted nearly 100 years. No, it would be more accurate to express that he was a guide for other characters by radiating light more brilliantly than anyone else. It's like a Polaris, the North Star. Twenty, forty, or hundred years, they deserve infinite respect because they have been loved for that long time. But Mickey, who has never descended from the top spot for nearly 100 years as many times as his competitors, is the winner.



##### Mickey Mouse & Friends (since 1928) > The Simpsons (since 1987) > Harry Potter (since 1997)

#### Criteria 2. Revenue



It's a really important field. For some, this comparison might be the whole thing. Rudolow believes in the child's mind and loves the purity of children, but it is difficult to express such minds objectively. After all, for comparison, it is reasonable to compare them as objective, quantified numbers. And it may be a cold reality, but it's true that profits ultimately determine the character's lifespan. Because of the love for the characters, many fans buy books and read and read like they want to memorize all the letters. Others like to watch the movie they watched when they went to the movie theater while holding their parents' hands. Some people sit in front of the TV in the traditional way and wait for live broadcasts, while many young viewers browse content through services like Netflix or YouTube in their smartphones. The way they express love is money. The fact that they continue to make more money shows that the love of the fans will never go out. The love is passed down from generation to generation. If the parents are fans, the children will be attracted to these characters. What would the parents do? They are happy to spend money once again for the children. The result is tremendous revenue. The ranking for profits is replaced by the link below. The rankings made by many experts are accurate and reliable.

#### Criteria 3. Awards



One of the objective indicators is the awards received by characters and content. There are many reasons why professionals who study and analyze this field are rewarding this work for its excellent content. Of course, it is difficult to know the judging criteria for every award, and I don't think that all of them will be objective. On their own basis, some content will receive awards, while others will be ignored for years. It's their taste. (like Rudolow) When the judges' tastes are satisfied, they receive a glorious prize. So I started to investigate the idea that this standard could have great significance. But soon I realized that this was a comparison that didn't make much sense. The awards received by the candidates were so gorgeous. As the number of awards has increased, counting is meaningless. For example, because this work has 44 awards, it cannot be seen as an advantage over works with only 42 awards. In addition, awards cannot be divided by authority. 'It was amazing to win this award, so it's kind of like winning three of those non-authoritative awards.' You may think, but this is not reasonable. It also occurred that it was not easy to compare the number and authority of awards simply because their main activities were different. There were a number of awards in their main areas, such as movies, TV and books. Can you compare the awards for movies, TV and books? Already they have won numerous awards for their character content in their respective fields. This is not a comparison. And they all have a career in the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are all equally great in that they carved their names on the streets of Hollywood that everyone knows.



##### Mickey Mouse & Friends = The Simpsons = Harry Potter

We compared the characters through the three fields above. As mentioned in the middle, we have respect for all three of these candidates. These are all very incredible works, and they laughed and cried a lot through them. Sometimes I jumped for joy, but sometimes I got depressed and sat down in my room. Comparing these candidates has proved to be a real challenge. Nevertheless, it is Rudolow's way to come to an unconditional conclusion. The most valuable work in character history will be the one that still remains the brightest light, even though it has been greatly loved for the longest time. Still, we love them so much and are willing to pay for them gladly and happily for generations. Even though there are a lot of competitors (increasing the number of highly contested candidates inside, like Marvel and Star Wars, for example), it seems that they should rise to the top. Once again tribute!
